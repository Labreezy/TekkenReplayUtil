# tekken-replay-system
A sharable replay system for Tekken 7.

## How To Use

### Recording

To record a match, simply double-click the program while at either...

1: At stage select, if possible
2: At "get ready for the next battle" all the way up until the intros start.

Doing so while in warm-up mode will record you in warm-up mode, thus starting it after you accept a search is reccomended.

It will record one match and one match only, as of the first version rematches in 1v1 lobbies, ranked, and quick matches break.  To stop recording in those situations, quit to warmup, the online menu, character select, or the lobby.

You can record matches you are spectating as well, same rules apply for starting the program.

## Stages (beta v1 issue)

When you save a replay, you have to rename it to indicate what stage it was on, or remember it somehow.  Otherwise, if you pick the wrong stage with the wrong dimensions (souq vs violet systems), the match won't play out correctly.  This issue is currently being worked on.

### Playback

To play a file back, first look at the filename and pick the characters in versus mode (but not the stage) that the filename tells you to pick.

Then, drag and drop the replay onto the .exe to start playback mode, and pick the correct stage (which i hope is in the filename).

If everything goes okay, you should have a functioning, happy tekken match that's going on without even pressing a button or a key.  

### Note

If you wish to stop playback or offline recording (for testing purposes) early, pause the game and it will stop.  

If you close out instead, restart tekken for safety.
